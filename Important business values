#Find the Truth and not your version of the Truth
-what's happened in business today is that there are different truths for the same question.
-If you losing market share and you ask  marketing why, they will our marketing is poor.
-If you ask operations why, they will say we are not delivery fast enough and cheaply.
-Same question, but different truths.

#Aim to be the best and not the biggest
-Finance tells you whats been, but they dont tell you whats coming.
-Aim to be the best at something.
-If you stop innovating you will always have new market entrants.

#Have a compelling vision
-numbers do not excite people, vision does. A stronger and more compelling vision of the future is far greater a motivator than a P&L pursuit.

#Lead By the business case
-Not the business person, whose who, what title they have, whether we like them or not.
